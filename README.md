# DynamicLandingPage

This is a very simple HTML, CSS and Javascript based Dynamic Landing Page. I have coded this project with the help of Youtube, Stackoverflow and many more coding sites.

I made this while keeping in mind the google expenstion Moment. We can also add a lot of other stuff like weather updates, a to-do list and etc which can help us make this a better personal dashboard. We can also convert this into an extension later on.

PLEASE REMEBER:

- If you really want to learn topics like Javascript, you should not just copy paste this project I would recommend you to just through typing it all out while seeing all the changes you have implemented on live server.

- The images used in this landing page are all from https://www.pexels.com/ and are free
